Be my forever girl, come into my life share my world
I can't pretend we're just friends, no easy way to say
What I feel in every way, no time for part time love
It's a game that goes nowhere, I'm not gonna play I swear
Somewhere somehow I just knew, that I would find someone like you
Door is open walk on through, there's not a thing I would not do for you.
Be my forever girl, come into my life share my world
Be my forever girl, to the end of time to the end of time
Some things are meant to be, these are not just empty words
These are lessons I have learnt, when you find love so strong
Got to take it with both hands, reach on out you know you can
Somewhere somehow I just knew, that I would find someone like you
Door is open walk on through, there's not a thing I would not do for you.
Be my forever girl, come into my life share my world
Be my forever girl, to the end of time to the end of time
Somewhere somehow I just knew, that I would find someone like you
Door is open walk on through, there's not a thing I would not do for you.
Be my forever girl, come into my life share my world
Be my forever girl, to the end of time to the end of time
Be my forever girl, come into my life share my world
Be my forever girl, to the end of time to the end of time
