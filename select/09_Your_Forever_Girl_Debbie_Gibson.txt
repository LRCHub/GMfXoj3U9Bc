On our wedding day
You may hear me say I love you
And I will forever
With this secret vow
We both should take a bow
Cause our love is
Stronger than ever
You can tell me that the weather's gonna change
My darling we will always stay the same
Our love it will remain forever
I do and you do too
It's like a summer a dream come true
And you I give you my word ooh ooh
I will and I will forever more
Promise to honor and adore
Cause I'm yours
Your forever girl
Never saw myself in the list
White picket fence and a wedding dress
But you saved me from the fear of forever
You can take your lights
And your neon sign
Nothing shines brighter
than your heart and mine
Yeah you know you are my one man show
Baby baby now my life is one hit song
Number one and always going strong
The one I've been singing all along
I do and you do too
It's like a summer a dream come true
And you I give you my word ooh ooh
I will and I will forever more
Promise to honor and adore
Cause I'm yours Your forever
Ooh baby now my life is one hit song
Number one and always going strong
The one I've been singing all along
I will and I will forever more
Promise to honor and adore
Cause I'm yours
Your forever girl
